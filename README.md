## Project Overview
XGBoost is a powerful and scalable gradient boosting framework widely used for regression and classification problems. This project demonstrates:
- The application of hyperparameter tuning techniques.
- Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the evaluation metric.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- A virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `conda`)

### Libraries
The following Python libraries are required:
- `xgboost`
- `scikit-learn`
- `optuna` (optional, for Bayesian Optimization)
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib` (for visualizing results)

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/xgboost-regressor-tuning.git
   cd xgboost-regressor-tuning
